# Proactive Human-Robot Collaborative Service Robot System

**An Interdiscplinary Capstone Project hosted by the Faculty of Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University**

Our proposed proactive robot serving Hong Kong elderly people in a household. The robot can grab objects and deliver them to the user based on the given audio command. As a proof of concept, four medicines are currently supported, including ACE Inhitbitor, Metformin, Atorvastatin, and Amitriptyline.
