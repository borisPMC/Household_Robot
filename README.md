# Proactive Human-Robot Collaborative Service Robot System

**An Interdisciplinary Final-Year Project hosted by the Faculty of Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University.**

Our proposed proactive robot serves Hong Kong elderly people in households. The robot can grab objects and deliver them to the user based on audio commands. As a proof of concept, our robot is currently capable of retrieving four types of medicine, including ACE Inhibitor, Metformin, Atorvastatin, and Amitriptyline.

## About this repository
The deployment scripts includes main.py and all scripts in _modules_ folder. After setting up everything (hardware, SDKs), run _main.py_ directly.

The _legacy_codes_ contains scripts and documents during the development stage and may be outdated and messy. These scripts are unexpected to be called when running the system.
